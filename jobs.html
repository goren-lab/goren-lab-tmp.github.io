<h3>Joining the group</h3>
<p>
We are looking for a post-doctorate researcher to develop a novel method for simultaneous mapping of the genomic location of multiple DNA-associated proteins. 
<p>
We are part of the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/"> Bioinformatics and Systems Biology</a> and <a href="http://biomedsci.ucsd.edu/">Biomedical Sciences (BMS)</a> graduate programs at UCSD and are accepting rotation students. Interested graduate, undergraduate, or masters students from other programs are welcome to get in touch.
