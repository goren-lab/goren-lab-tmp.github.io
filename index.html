<h1>Welcome to the Goren Lab</h1>
<p>
The Goren Lab is located at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). We are part of the Department of Medicine's Division of Genetics. We are also members of the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/">Bioinformatics and Systems Biology</a> and <a href="http://biomedsci.ucsd.edu/">Biomedical Sciences (BMS)</a> programs
</p>

<h2>What do we do?</h2>
Our interdisciplinary research focuses on epigenomic mechanisms and their dynamics. To this end, we merge basic biology, technological innovations and computational analyses. We are mainly interested in developmental-epigenomic questions, and study chromatin in uncharted settings. We investigate and characterize the epigenomic organization and the roles chromatin regulators (CRs) play during mammalian early development and along the cell cycle. See the <a href="research.html">research page</a> for more details!
