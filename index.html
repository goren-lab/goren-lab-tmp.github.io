<h1>Welcome to the Goren Lab</h1>
<p>
The Goren Lab is located at the University of California San Diego. We are part of the Department of Medicine's Division of Genetics. We are also a member of the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/">Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program</a> and 
</p>

<h2>What do we do?</h2>
Our overall goal is to understand complex genetic variants that underlie human disease. We are particularly interested in repetitive DNA variants known as short tandem repeats (STRs) as a model for complex variation. Our work will focus on developing computational tools for analyzing and visualizing complex variation from large-scale sequencing data and applying these tools to learn about the contribution of repetitive variation to human disease. See the <a href="research.html">research page</a> to learn more!
